=== Until first BETA ===
- write identity insert keys to plain text file
- check whether we can output evil HTML? (this would be bad), always send HTML output through the freenet filter
- use priority queue for fetches to make sure that own identities are fetched before all others on the queue
-- required for quickly restoring multiple identities
- make priority levels and such configurable
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions (CSS)


=== After first BETA ===

- Fix the bucket leaking problem (if it still exists)
- specify the identity restore key format
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- add random delay to identity insertion? -> after a restart of freenet local identities may be inserted at similar times.
-- Correlating USK updates times could lead to identity compromise.


=== FAR FUTURE ===
- add event pushing framework thingy such that plugins don't need to fetch the full WoT every N minutes
- check that an ssk request schedule always gets removed from the backlog even if the XML contains errors and thus an identity update isn't executed.
