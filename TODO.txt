- support deleting properties from your own profile at will
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- check whether we can output evil HTML? (this would be bad)
- specify the identity restore key format
- ShowIdentity with id that hasn't been fetched yet throws NullPointerException, should just display in UI that the identity hasn't been fetched yet
- use priority queue for fetches to make sure that own identities are fetched before all others on the queue

- RELEASE FOR BETA TESTING

- fix link between getIdentitiesByScore and getIdentity, requires refactoring
- fix getIdentitiesbyScore inefficiency (optimize using graph db call)
- incremental score recomputation on identity update
- add random delay to identity insertion? -> after a restart of freenet local identities may be inserted at similar times. 
--- Correlating USK updates times could lead to identity compromise.

FAR FUTURE:
- add event pushing framework thingy
- clean-up some vertices from the the WoT using some criterium
