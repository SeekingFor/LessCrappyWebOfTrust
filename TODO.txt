- getIdentitiesByScore can work with a VertexIterator basically iterating the resultset until the vertex_id changes (new element) or the end is reached
-- wraps around a resultset
-- requires sorting
-- reduce the number of db calls for getIdentityByScore & friends
- Fix the bucket leaking problem
- schedule WoT score calculation updates using requestScheduler
- write identity insert keys to plain text file
- ShowIdentity with id that hasn't been fetched yet throws NullPointerException, should just display in UI that the identity hasn't been fetched yet
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- check whether we can output evil HTML? (this would be bad)
- specify the identity restore key format
- use priority queue for fetches to make sure that own identities are fetched before all others on the queue
- make priority levels and such configurable
- investigate: freenet:CHK@axAXtKUbJBGBqG-P3BnexykoFVTI4tOWaOmjeC1LTZs,ft2FxCgqHo5DJxaeydT4FT6wOM4AP6LYTKfxANmOZT8,AAIC--8/trace


- RELEASE FOR BETA TESTING

- add random delay to identity insertion? -> after a restart of freenet local identities may be inserted at similar times. 
--- Correlating USK updates times could lead to identity compromise.

FAR FUTURE:
- add event pushing framework thingy such that plugins don't need to fetch the full WoT every N minutes
- clean-up some vertices from the the WoT using some criterium
