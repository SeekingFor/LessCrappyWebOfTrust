- Support a context of "" that will return all identities, not the identities with an empty string context, also allow getting all identities when the context is not present.
-- required for freemail 0.2.0 compat
- ShowIdentity with id that hasn't been fetched yet throws NullPointerException, should just display in UI that the identity hasn't been fetched yet
- Beautify HTML pages for various actions
- create page where you can search for an identity and go to its identity info page (listing all identities is CRAZY)
- check whether we can output evil HTML? (this would be bad)
- specify the identity restore key format
- use priority queue for fetches to make sure that own identities are fetched before all others on the queue

- RELEASE FOR BETA TESTING

- fix getIdentitiesbyScore inefficiency (optimize using graph db call)
- add random delay to identity insertion? -> after a restart of freenet local identities may be inserted at similar times. 
--- Correlating USK updates times could lead to identity compromise.

FAR FUTURE:
- add event pushing framework thingy
- clean-up some vertices from the the WoT using some criterium
